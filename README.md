# Holy Crap! Fork is Back!

PSA: As Starstorm 2 became available in the current RoR2 version, I recommend disabling the Fork item of this mod if you're gonna use Starstorm 2.

Uninspired item mod by yours truly.

It currently adds 4 white items (Including 1 Void counterpart!), 1 green item and 3 red items.

**1.0.4**

- Buffed Spoon, +0.02 Base Damage per stack, max stacks reduced to 50, so it stacks faster now. Also now it scales with 25% of player level (This is a buff, it mistakenly said on the description that it scaled with 30% of PL, in reality it scaled with 20% of PL).
